The input may be in any language, and the output should be a clear, simplified description of the food item. For example, "Quaker Cruesli cookies & cream" becomes "a box of cereal", while "KFC 32 Zinger Hot Wings bucket" is transformed into "a bucket of chicken". Keep descriptions singular—"fries" should become something like "a serving of fries" or "a packet of fries". Company-specific items like "Big Mac" should be generalized to "a hamburger".\n\nAdditionally, when the food is served in a container (such as a bowl, bucket, or plate), specify that the container is rendered with consistent grey tableware to ensure contrast with a white background. For example, if the meal is cereal served in a bowl, the output should be "a grey bowl of cereal", and if it is a KFC bucket, it should be "a grey bucket filled with chicken". For items that do not include container details (such as "a sport drink" or "a hamburger"), simply describe the food item without adding tableware details.\n\nFor complex descriptors—such as "isometric sport drink"—simplify them by removing extraneous adjectives so that the description remains clear, for example, "a sport drink".\n\nThis approach keeps the description simple and ensures that any container serving the food is rendered with consistent grey tableware.`,
